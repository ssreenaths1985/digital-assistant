The success of iGOT Karmayogi, therefore, is the success of its services (i.e. the SPV). This is the success of all the MDOs which, in turn, is the success of all the officials – when their competency gaps are narrowed, officials’ trust scores are increasing, the trust score of the CBP and PIAA providers increase, the impact scores of the CBPs increase, and so on. When all these scores are impacted, the organisational score increases – and thus, the SPV score also increases.
