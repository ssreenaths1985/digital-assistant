                    lengths proportional to the values that they represent. The
                    bars can be plotted vertically or horizontally. A vertical
                    bar chart is sometimes called a column chart.

                    Some bar graphs present bars clustered in groups of more
                    than one, showing the values of more than one measured

                  <p className="justifyContent">
                    A bubble chart is a type of chart that displays three
                    dimensions of data. Each entity with its triplet (v1, v2,
                    v3) of associated data is plotted as a disk that expresses
                    two of the vi values through the disk's xy location and the
                    third through its size. Bubble charts can facilitate the
                    understanding of social, economical, medical, and other
                    scientific relationships.

                    Bubble charts can be considered a variation of the scatter
                    plot, in which the data points are replaced with bubbles. As
                    the documentation for Microsoft Office explains, "You can
                    use a bubble chart instead of a scatter chart if your data
                    has three data series that each contain a set of values. The
                    sizes of the bubbles are determined by the values in the
                    third data series.".

                  <p className="justifyContent">
                    A donut chart is essentially a Pie Chart with an area of the
                    centre cut out. Pie Charts are sometimes criticised for
                    focusing readers on the proportional areas of the slices to
                    one another and to the chart as a whole. This makes it
                    tricky to see the differences between slices, especially
                    when you try to compare multiple Pie Charts together.
                  </p>

                  <p className="justifyContent">
                    A Donut Chart somewhat remedies this problem by
                    de-emphasizing the use of the area. Instead, readers focus
                    more on reading the length of the arcs, rather than
                    comparing the proportions between slices. Also, Donut Charts
                    are more space-efficient than Pie Charts because the blank
                    space inside a Donut Chart can be used to display
                    information inside it.

                    A line chart or line plot or line graph or curve chart is a
                    type of chart which displays information as a series of data
                    points called 'markers' connected by straight line segments.
                    It is a basic type of chart common in many fields. It is
                    similar to a scatter plot except that the measurement points
                    are ordered (typically by their x-axis value) and joined
                    with straight line segments. A line chart is often used to
                    visualize a trend in data over intervals of time – a time
                    series – thus the line is often drawn chronologically. In
                    these cases they are known as run charts.

                    A pie chart (or a circle chart) is a circular statistical
                    graphic, which is divided into slices to illustrate
                    numerical proportion. In a pie chart, the arc length of each
                    slice (and consequently its central angle and area), is
                    proportional to the quantity it represents. While it is
                    named for its resemblance to a pie which has been sliced,
                    there are variations on the way it can be presented.

                    Pie charts are very widely used in the business world and
                    the mass media. However, they have been criticized,[4] and
                    many experts recommend avoiding them, pointing out that
                    research has shown it is difficult to compare different
                    sections of a given pie chart, or to compare data across
                    different pie charts. Pie charts can be replaced in most
                    cases by other plots such as the bar chart, box plot, dot

                    A scatter chart (also called a scatterplot, scatter graph,
                    scatter chart, scattergram, or scatter diagram) is a type of
                    plot or mathematical diagram using Cartesian coordinates to
                    display values for typically two variables for a set of
                    data. If the points are coded (color/shape/size), one
                    additional variable can be displayed. The data are displayed
                    as a collection of points, each having the value of one
                    variable determining the position on the horizontal axis and
                    the value of the other variable determining the position on
                    the vertical axis.

                    A table chart is a means of arranging data in rows and
                    columns. The use of tables is pervasive throughout all
                    communication, research and data analysis. Tables appear in
                    print media, handwritten notes, computer software,
                    architectural ornamentation, traffic signs and many other
                    places. The precise conventions and terminology for
                    describing tables varies depending on the context.

                  <p className="justifyContent">
                    Treemaps display hierarchical (tree-structured) data as a
                    set of nested rectangles. Each branch of the tree is given a
                    rectangle, which is then tiled with smaller rectangles
                    representing sub-branches. A leaf node's rectangle has an
                    area proportional to a specified dimension of the data.
                    Often the leaf nodes are colored to show a separate
                    dimension of the data.

                  <p className="justifyContent">
                    When the color and size dimensions are correlated in some
                    way with the tree structure, one can often easily see
                    patterns that would be difficult to spot in other ways, such
                    as if a certain color is particularly relevant. A second
                    advantage of treemaps is that, by construction, they make
                    efficient use of space. As a result, they can legibly
                    display thousands of items on the screen simultaneously.

                    A violin plot is a method of plotting numeric data. It is
                    similar to a box plot, with the addition of a rotated kernel
                    density plot on each side. Violin plots are similar to box
                    plots, except that they also show the probability density of
                    the data at different values, usually smoothed by a kernel
                    density estimator. Typically a violin plot will include all
                    the data that is in a box plot: a marker for the median of
                    the data; a box or marker indicating the interquartile
                    range; and possibly all sample points, if the number of
                    samples is not too high.

                  <p className="justifyContent">
                    A violin plot is more informative than a plain box plot.
                    While a box plot only shows summary statistics such as
                    mean/median and interquartile ranges, the violin plot shows
                    the full distribution of the data. The difference is
                    particularly useful when the data distribution is multimodal
                    (more than one peak). In this case a violin plot shows the
                    presence of different peaks, their position and relative
                    amplitude.

                    A area chart or area graph displays graphically quantitative

                    and line are commonly emphasized with colors, textures and
                    hatchings. Commonly one compares two or more quantities with
